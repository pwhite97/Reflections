I was very pleased by the tutorial because I never knew the command line could be used to find differences in files so quickly. This will be very useful in the future.
Having the entire history of a file's history makes you more efficient by being able to learn where you went wrong before, and by being able to reuse pieces of code.
The adavantage of choosing to commit includes being able to commit at logical points, and to keep commit history from being cluttered. However, sometimes bad  judgment could be exercised.
Google Docs usually don't contain content that needs to san more than one document.
Git log allows you to see commit history and git diff allows you to see the difference between two files.
Even if the changes I make break something, I can discard it.
There are so many things to use git for!
