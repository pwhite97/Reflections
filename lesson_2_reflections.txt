When you initialize a new repository, files from your directory are added to the repository but not committed. You need to do it if you want to keep track of versions.
The staging area is the intermediate step between the working directory and the repository. I like it because it gives you the freedom to choose what goes in the repository.
The staging area makes sure that you transfer one logical change at a time from th directory to the repository.
Branches are great for making a version of the master that caters to a different group without disturbing the master.
Diagrams make the branching process easy to see and follow.
Merging two branches makes one file.
